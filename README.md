# Customer_Churn_Prediction_System
## Project Overview

Customer churn means customers leaving a service.
For telecom companies, churn directly results in revenue loss.

The goal of this project is to predict customer churn early, so companies can take preventive actions such as targeted offers, improved customer support, or personalized retention strategies.

This project demonstrates how a machine learning model can be taken from data preprocessing to a usable application with a backend API and a simple frontend interface.

## Key Objectives

Build a supervised ML model for churn prediction

Design a clean ML pipeline (preprocessing → training → evaluation)

Serve predictions using a FastAPI backend

Provide a simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend for user interaction

## Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Random Forest)

Backend: FastAPI

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Churn Prediction + Probability

# Machine Learning Details

Problem Type: Binary Classification

Target Variable: Churn (Yes / No)

Model Used: Random Forest Classifier

# Features:

Customer profile

Service usage

Billing information

# Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

ROC-AUC

# Backend (FastAPI)

Exposes a /predict endpoint

Accepts customer details as JSON

Returns:

Churn prediction (0 / 1)

Churn probability

CORS is enabled to allow frontend–backend communication.

# Frontend

Simple form-based interface

Users enter customer details

Click Predict Churn to get:

Prediction result

Probability

Risk level (Low / Medium / High)

This frontend is designed to demonstrate ML usage, not for production UI.
